## Description

For this project I reconfigured a working app to work with graphQL and apollo server. This app allows users to search any book of their chooseing and get detailed information back about the selected book. Users are able to create an account and save books that they are interested in. The movitation behind this assignment was to get more familiar with apollo server and GraphQL.
